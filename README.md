# SUAI_LAB2
Variant 11

### Task 1

Define a class named ROUTE containing the following fields:
- name of the starting point of the route
- name of the final destination of the route
- Route number

Define access methods to these fields and overloaded extraction and insertion operations for ROUTE type objects.
Write a program that performs the following actions:
- entering data from the keyboard into an array consisting of eight objects type ROUTE; entries should be ordered by route numbers
- displaying information about routes that start or end at the point whose name is entered from the keyboard
- if there are no such routes, display the corresponding message

### Task 2

Using file and string streams, write a program that reads text from a file and displays only strings that do not contain two-digit numbers.

### Restrictions

- Dynamic memory allocation
- No STL containers
- Full user menu
- User's access to interact with each of the inherited objects: add, delete, display, change data, etc
- All constructors, operator redefinition. Each call to
the constructor and destructor must be accompanied by the output of this
information to the user (which object, which constructor or destructor is
called)
- Set and get methods
- Exceptions
- Inheriting classes from the base class should define their essence by
variables and methods for working with them
